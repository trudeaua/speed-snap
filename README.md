Code for the hybrid app "Speed Snap"

### Introduction

Speed Snap is a hybrid app built using Ionic 2 that is designed for graphic designers and sign surveyors. It allows user's to enter their company info, and create multiple "Survey Sessions" for clients in their contact list. In a survey session, user's can quickly snap pictures of signs, or survey sites, and add measurements, notes, and quantities. After the user is done a survey, they can save it for later and/or export it to PDF. Speed Snap also allows the generated PDF to be printed or emailed.
